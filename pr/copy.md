## Elevator Pitch

It can be hard to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccine in New York State.
Appointment availability changes frequently, and the only way to find out is to reload a Web page repeatedly.

This is stressful and costly, and it’s also unfair: it privileges those who have the time and flexibility to do that.
Access to healthcare shouldn’t be contingent upon income, wealth, or schedule flexibility.

So we’ve launched [ny.vax.help](https://ny.vax/help) to make it easier and fairer for New Yorkers to get vaccination appointments.
Sign up at [ny.vax.help](https://ny.vax/help) and the website will send you an email as soon as your selected providers have availability.

I had to make this shorter to fit when translated to Spanish by Google Translate.

Shortened English version:
